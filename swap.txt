# You already created the file and set permissions correctly ✓
# Now run these commands:

# Format the file as swap
sudo mkswap /swapfile

# Enable the swap
sudo swapon /swapfile

# Make it permanent (survive reboots)
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Optimize swap usage (only use when really needed)
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
echo 'vm.swappiness=10' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

# Verify it's working
free -h
```

The issue was `sudo mkubuntu@ip...$ swap` - it should be `sudo mkswap` (all one word).

After running these commands, you should see output like:
```
